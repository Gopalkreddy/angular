import { signal } from "@angular/core"

install angular : npm install -g @angular/cli

with specific version : npm install -g @angular/cli@<version>

create new angular project : ng new <project-name>
serve angular project : cd <project-name> && ng serve
build angular project : ng build
for maintaining node versions : use nvm (Node Version Manager)
older version of node : nvm install <version>
switch node version : nvm use <version>
list installed node versions : nvm ls
list available node versions : nvm ls-remote

define angular component : ng generate component <component-name>
define angular service : ng generate service <service-name>
define angular module : ng generate module <module-name>
define angular directive : ng generate directive <directive-name>
what is component : A component controls a patch of screen called a view. It consists of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and optional CSS styles.
what is service : A service is a class that provides specific functionality and can be shared across components.
what is module : A module is a container that groups related components, services, directives, and pipes.
what is directive : A directive is a class that adds behavior to elements in your Angular applications.

data binding in angular : Data binding is a mechanism for coordinating parts of a template with parts of a component. It allows you to define communication between the component class and the template.

types of data binding in angular :
1. Interpolation: {{ value }}
2. Property Binding: [property]="value"
we can even use class and style bindings
3. Event Binding: (event)="handler()"
4. Two-Way Binding: [(ngModel)]="property"

signal in angular : Signals are a reactive primitive that allow you to create reactive state in your Angular applications. They enable automatic updates to the UI when the underlying data changes.    



export class SignalEx {
  title = signal('Hello, Angular Signals!');
  name =signal<string>('Gopal')
}   

for calling signal value use () parentheses like function call

example : 
In template : <h1>{{ title() }}</h1>
In component : console.log(this.title())

signal set value : use set() method

example :
this.title.set('New Title');

signal will work only in angular 16 and above versions with node 18 and above versions

control flow in angular : Control flow in Angular refers to the mechanisms that allow you to control the rendering of elements in your templates based on certain conditions or iterations. Angular provides structural directives for this purpose.

types of control flow directives in angular :
1. *ngIf : Conditionally includes or excludes a template based on the value of an expression.
2. *ngFor : Repeats a template for each item in a collection.
3. *ngSwitch : Conditionally includes one of several templates based on the value of an expression.

example of *ngIf :
In template :
<div *ngIf="isVisible">This content is visible.</div>

In component :
isVisible = true;

@if isVisible is true, the div will be rendered; otherwise, it will be removed from the DOM.

Routing in angular : Routing in Angular is a mechanism that allows you to navigate between different views or components within a single-page application (SPA). It enables you to define routes, which map URLs to specific components, allowing users to navigate through the application without reloading the entire page.

To set up routing in an Angular application, you typically follow these steps:

1. Import the RouterModule and Routes from @angular/router in your app.module.ts file.
2. Define your routes as an array of objects, where each object specifies a path and the corresponding component to render.
3. Use the RouterModule.forRoot() method to configure the router with your defined routes.
4. Add a <router-outlet> directive in your main template (usually app.component.html) to serve as a placeholder for the routed components.
5. Use routerLink directives in your templates to create navigation links.

Example:

In app.module.ts:
import { RouterLink, RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
    {
        path: 'admin',
        component:Admin
    },
    {
        path: 'user',
        component: User
    },
    {
        path: 'control-flow',
        component: ContrlFlow
    },
    {
        path: 'data-binding',
        component: DataBinding
    }
];

RouterLink : The RouterLink directive is used to create navigation links in Angular applications. It allows you to define clickable elements that navigate to different routes defined in your routing configuration.

To use RouterLink, you typically bind it to a path defined in your routing configuration. When the user clicks on the element with the RouterLink directive, Angular's router will navigate to the specified route without reloading the entire page.

Example:

In template:
<a routerLink="/admin">Go to Admin</a>
<a routerLink="/user">Go to User</a>

In this example, clicking on the "Go to Admin" link will navigate to the /admin route, and clicking on the "Go to User" link will navigate to the /user route. The corresponding components for these routes will be rendered in the <router-outlet> defined in your main template.
